Work in progress. Mac app which uses Kinect.

### Depth to RGB

The [libfreenect](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) library
includes a very helpful example, but I had to work extra hard to make
sense of the code which translates the depth buffer value to some rgb
value for display. Visualizing depth values could be done a million
ways. Initially, I just scaled the value to 8-bit for grayscale. But I
was intrigued by the logic in
[this example code](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/blob/master/examples/glview.c#L290-L340).

First off, if you initialize the depth camera like so:

```c
freenect_set_depth_mode(f_dev, freenect_find_depth_mode(
    FREENECT_RESOLUTION_MEDIUM, FREENECT_DEPTH_11BIT));
```

And if we use the routine from the `glview.c` linked above, we get an
image with a color range like this:

_the red dot is just some opengl drawing, ignore that_

Ok so, in this mode, the depth camera is giving us 11-bit (2048)
values. The first step done for each sample, is a lookup in
the `t_gamma` array, of length 2048. The array is initialized like so:

```c
// init gamma array
for (int i=0; i < 2048; i++) {
    float v = i / 2048.0;
    
    v = powf(v, 3) * 6;
    t_gamma[i] = v * 6 * 256;
}
```

If we plot the array, to visualize like a function, we get:
